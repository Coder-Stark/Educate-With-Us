                be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on
                social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power
                to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must
                for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a
                lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">With the advent of technological innovations across industries, the
                education sector turns out to be the most influenced. In-fact, technology has been playing a prominent
                role at the forefront of education ever since learning and development came into being, right from
                carving symbols and figures on walls of caves, to Gurukul education where the students were taught the
                use of the technology prevailing then, to using of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality
                (VR).</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Early childhood development (ECD) is a significant phase of growth and
                development that influences outcomes across an individual’s entire life and provides an important window
                of opportunity to prepare the foundation for lifelong learning and participation (World Health
                Organization [WHO], 2011). New government policy in Malawi sets out to increase the number of children
                with disabilities accessing ECD, particularly in community-based childcare centres (CBCCs). As such the
                UK Department for International Development, which has Malawi as one of its key target countries, funded
                the ‘Let’s Grow Together’ project, a three year (2015 to 2018) .</p>
